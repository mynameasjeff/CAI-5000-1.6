## Gameplay Features
- Tactical pathfinding: Pawns will avoid LOS along the entire path they choose as well as any danger.
- Killbox killer: pawns will avoid killboxes and other funnels. Pawns will dig if they find a path to be too dangerous.
- Light speed reactions: pawns will react to enemies (detect) in less than 0.2 MS.
- Tactical thinking: pawns will retreat, regroup, lure you into simple ambushes and they'll consider their armor and your ability to damage them. Pawns also have a much smarter cover selection system.
